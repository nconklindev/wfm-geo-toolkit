## What is this? 🤔

This started as a tool to aid in the troubleshooting of geofencing issues that users of Pro WFM face while using the
companion mobile app. Since then, it has evolved to be a broader toolkit that includes other functionality to help make
the user experience smoother and easier to troubleshoot.

## Who is this for? 🧩

I built this tool with the goal of making it easier for users of Pro WFM to troubleshoot their geofencing issues. That
would include those in Support, consultants, and customers. The tool is free to use, so anyone can give it a try
risk-free.

## How do I use it?

To get started, you may navigate directly to https://wfmgeotoolkit.app/tools and get started by selecting from any of
the available tools. Alternatively, select a tool from the Tools dropdown menu in the navigation menu.
