## How to contribute to WFM Toolkit

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**

    * A security policy is to come. Stay tuned!

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/nconklindev/wfm-geo-toolkit/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the
  problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/nconklindev/wfm-geo-toolkit/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml). Fill out
  the provided form, and your bug will be submitted. We can't guarantee a turnaround time of any kind, but we try to
  address issues as soon as possible by level of priority.

### **Want to add a feature or contribute to the project?**

* All changes must be linked to an open Issue first, using
  the [Feature Request](https://github.com/nconklindev/wfm-geo-toolkit/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) form.
    * If you intend to add code to the project in any way (fixing a bug, adding a feature), please open the Feature
      Request and add a comment stating, "I'd like to work on this."
    * Once you've received approval for the feature, proceed with forking the repository and creating the proper branch
      for your feature.
    * Follow the instructions on the [wiki](https://github.com/nconklindev/wfm-geo-toolkit/wiki/Contributing) for how to
      set up your environment locally

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any questions in the [Discussion](https://github.com/nconklindev/wfm-geo-toolkit/discussions) boards. Label your
  posts appropriately, and let @nconklindev know if a label is missing.

WFM Toolkit is an unofficial tool and not officially supported by the company the tool supports.
